[Six (6) design principles embodied in desgin patterns](./principles_of_design.md)

### creational

Creational patterns involve object instantiation and all provide a way to decouple a client from the objects it needs to instantiate.

[factory](./factory.md)

[abstract factory](./abstract_factory.md)

[builder](./builder.md)

[prototype](./prototype.md)

[singleton](./singleton.md)

### structural

Structural patterns let you compose classes or objects into better structures fitting the problem context.

[adapter](./adapter.md)

[bridge](./bridge.md)

[composite](./composite.md)

[decorator](./decorator.md)

[facade](./facade.md)

[flyweight](./flyweight.md)

[proxy](./prototype.md)

### behavioral

Any pattern that is a Behavioral Pattern is concerned with how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility.

[chain](./chain.md)

[command](./command.md)

[interpreter](./interpreter.md)

[iterator](./iterator.md)

[mediator](./mediator.md)

[observer](./observer.md)

[state](./state.md)

[strategy](./strategy.md)

[visitor](./visitor.md)
